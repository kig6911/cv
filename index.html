        <p><em>Junior DataOps Engineer at Innovu, LLC</em></p>
        <p>I am a junior data operations engineer at <a href="https://Innovu.com">Innovu, LLC</a> located in Pittsburgh, PA.
          I specialize in writing SQL queries in PostGRES and cleaning data that comes in <br /> from
          various organizations monthly. I operate on a weekly release schedule with other employees
          at Innovu. I also am pursuing my masters with a Database <br /> spcialization in Information
          Technology at UMUC. In my free time, I like to practice my web development skills and
          SQL querying. I love video games and practicing <br /> for my first 5K!</p>
